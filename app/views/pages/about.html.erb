                <p class='light center'>
                  We run fast and we run lean. When our operating environment changes, and new challenges emerge, we're ready to respond. We communicate as early and as often as possible, and default to overcommunication in all of our interactions. We always look for a better, more effective, and more efficient way to run our operations.
