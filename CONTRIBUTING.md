## Setting Up Your Environment
* In order to work on the **Operation Code** site, you will need to install a few things.
  * Beginner's Note: If you don't have Ruby and Ruby on Rails installed in your system yet, don't worry about it. After you clone the GitHub repository, they will be installed during the `bundle` command along with all the dependencies.  

  ### Ruby
  Ruby is an Object-Oriented programming language that **Operation Code** is written in. While you can install Ruby directly to your machine, it is highly recommended to use a version manager. We recommend RVM, but rbenv will also work.

  * [Install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
  * Look [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationCode/operationcode/master/.ruby-version) to find the version of Ruby we are using
  * Install the version of Ruby from the step above. Example: `rvm install 2.3.0`

  ### Git
  Git is a distributed version control system. This is how our code is stored and managed. Git can be frustrating, but it is an essential tool. If you want to learn more about Git, a great resource is [Think Like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/). If you find yourself in a real git pickle, see ["Oh, shit, git!"](http://ohshitgit.com/).

  * [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


  ### GitHub
  GitHub is a web-based repository where the Operation Code website's source code is hosted.  GitHub utilizes Git's version control system and allows other developers to contribute to the codebase.  If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, we recommend running through the free online training resources they offer.

  * [GitHub Training](https://services.github.com/training/)   

  ### PostgreSQL
  PostgreSQL is an open source Object-Relational database. This stores all of **Operation Code**'s data.

  * [Official Linux Installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/)
    * [General Guide for Linux Installations](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)

  * [Official Mac OSX Installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/)
    * [Postgres.app for Mac](http://postgresapp.com/) *This is another installation option for Mac users.*

  * [Official Windows Installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
    * [Detailed Windows Installation Instructions](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides#Windows)

  ### Redis
  Redis is used to manage asynchronous jobs. You will need to run your Redis server in order for normal operation of the main app server.

  If you're working on an area that uses `ActiveJob` you'll need to work with Redis more directly.

  * [Install Redis](http://redis.io/download)
  * If you are using a Mac, you can install it through Homebrew: `brew install redis`
  * Redis is not supported on Windows.
  * Start your Redis server: `redis-server`

  ### Bundler
  Bundler manages Ruby gems (packages) and their dependencies.

  * `gem install bundler`

  ### Node
  Node.js is a server-side Javascript environment.

  **The easiest way to install node and npm is with [n-install](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install)**
  There will be a confirmation prompt, then a subsequent installation of the latest stable Node.js version:
  ```
  curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash
  ```
  *Make sure you go over the repository's README.md for usage details.*

  #### Node Downloads
  * [Linux Install Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
  * [Mac Install Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#osx)
  * [Windows Install Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows)

  ### Operation Code
  You are now ready for the actual **Operation Code** code base.

  * The common practice is to make a copy of the GitHub repository you want to work on (known as `forking` the repo), make your changes, and then request to merge those changes back into the project (known as a `pull request`).
  * Forking a repo is done through GitHub's web UI. It can be found in the top right corner of the **Operation Code**'s [GitHub](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode) page.

  * The following commands will pull down the source code, and install the necessary dependencies:
  * Make sure to replace `[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME]` with your GitHub name.  (example: https://github.com/iserbit/operationcode.git)

  #### Local Development Environment
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME]/operationcode.git operationcode-upstream
    cd operationcode-upstream
    bundle
    rake db:setup
    thin start --ssl
    ```

  #### Known Issues:
  When running the `bundle` command, you may encounter a problem with the `pg` gem. In order to resolve this problem, go through the following steps:
  ##### Windows:

    * In your terminal, type the following: `find /Applications -name pg_config` This should return the path of the `pg_config` script.
      * Example return: `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin/pg_config`
    * Set the returned path as your path: `PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin/`
    * Install the `pg` gem with the following command: `gem install pg`
    * Add the `PATH` to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`
    * Type `bundle` or `bundle install` again to finish installing any remaining gems.

  ##### Linux:

    * Install the following packages:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev
    ```

  #### Database Setup:
  When setting up the database, you may encounter a problem with Postgres database creation. Setup proper user permissions for the database and the tables to be created.

  _Official Documentation:_

    * [Add Users and Roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/database-roles.html)
    * [Role Attributes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/role-attributes.html)
    * [Privileges](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/privileges.html)
    * [Role Membership](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/role-membership.html)

  ##### Tutorial:
    * __[How To Use Roles and Manage Grant Permissions in PostgreSQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-roles-and-manage-grant-permissions-in-postgresql-on-a-vps--2)__

  #### Rails on Cloud9:
  * Cloud9 is a web-based integrated development environment. If you do not much experience in setting up a work environment, we highly recommend Cloud9 to start.
  * [Getting Rails to work in Cloud9 in 5 easy steps!](https://ashtemp.github.io/Rails.html)
  * When cloning your fork into Cloud9, create your workspace name and description, then select Ruby as the template.
  * In the terminal, type in the following commands:

  ```bash
  gem install rails
  bundle install
  rails server -b $IP -p $PORT
  createdb operationcode_development
  ```

  * Sometimes, you may have to restart the postgress server with `sudo service postgresql restart`.
  * Your fork of **Operation Code** website should now be available for preview at http://workpacename-username.c9users.io (ie: http://operationcode-ashtemp.c9users.io)

## Finding An Issue
* Now you have everything setup, you will need to find issues to work on. **Operation Code** uses Github's built in issue tracker. A listing of all our issues can be found [here](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/issues).

* Familiarize yourself with the issue types below, and browse for an issue that you want to work on. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification or help.

* Once you have found an issue, leave a comment stating that you plan to work on the issue. Once assigned to you, your mission is a go!

  ### Issue Types
  * Issue types are managed through labels. The below labels help us easily identify and manage issues with different workflows.

  #### [bug](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/labels/bug)
  Bugs are errors in code that produce unintended or unexpected results. In addition to the `bug` label, there may also be a tag indicating what the bug affects. For example [issue#124](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/issues/124) was a bug that affected the testing environment.

  #### [feature](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/labels/feature)
  Features either add new functionality or improve existing functionality.

  #### [discussion](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/labels/discussion)
  Discussions will generally not have specific actionable items in them, and can be used to plan and design a feature.

  #### [milestones](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/milestones)
  Milestones are used as containers for new issues pertaining to a project, timeframe or feature.

  #### [beginner-friendly](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/labels/beginner%20friendly)
  These items are hand picked as being great candidates as your first issue to work on.

## Working On Your Issue

* From the forked and cloned repository on your environment, you can now create a [feature branch](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). It is a good idea to name your branch after the issue it is attached to.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>
   ```

* You can check the branch your are currently working on by using the `branch` command.
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```

* Once you have finished your work, head over to **Operation Code**'s main GitHub page, and make a pull request. More information about pull requests can be found in the next section.

* To return to your main `master` branch, type the following in the terminal:
  ```bash
  git checkout master
  ```

## Submitting Your Changes
* When you have completed work on your feature branch, you are ready to submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

* Each pull request should:

  * Be tied to a single issue
  * Be fully tested
  * Have its own tests
  * Not break existing tests

* Once your pull request has been submitted, it will be reviewed by a core team member. This process helps to familiarize more people with the codebase, and provides a second set of eyes and perspective to your new feature.

* If your code is accepted, it will be merged into the `master` branch. If all the tests pass, it will be automatically deployed to [operationcode.org](operationcode.org) immediately.

* Congratulations! You have made your first contribution!

  ### Bots

  * Each pull request is inspected by the following bots:

    * [Hound](https://houndci.com) - Checks for style validation errors during pull requests. If it finds any errors, it will post a follow-up comment on the issue with the errors. Think of Hound as your Drill Sergeant. If this happens with a pull request you are submitting, please fix the errors and resubmit.

    * [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) - Runs the test suite on each check in, and deploys each change that gets merged.

  ### Add yourself

  * Once your pull requests has been merged, don't forget to add your name to the list of contributors in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Code Standards

* ### HTML

  [Adhere to the Code Guide.](http://codeguide.co/#html)

  * Use tags and elements appropriate for an HTML5 doctype (ex: self-closing tags).
  * Use CDNs and HTTPS for third-party JS when possible. We don't use protocol-relative URLs in this case because they break when viewing the page locally via `file://`.
